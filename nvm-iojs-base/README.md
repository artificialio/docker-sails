The goal of this image is to be a minimally sized (~306MB) docker image that still allows to build native addons such as node-sass or bcrypt. Furthermore it is installing nvm which is then used to install the latest iojs without the need for sudo.

This image is the basis for all [SANE](http://sanestack.com/) docker images.
