Docker-sails
============

This Docker Container is installing the latest version of [Sails](http://sailsjs.org/) as well as [PM2](https://github.com/Unitech/PM2) to manage the app.
This is still WIP and is meant to be rolled into [sane](https://github.com/artificialio/sane)/[sane-cli](https://github.com/artificialio/sane-cli) together with https://github.com/artificialio/docker-gen-nginx and [Fig](http://www.fig.sh/)

sane-cli and fig together will give you an ecosystem, to get your fullstack app started immensly fast, make it completely customizable (you can easily choose MySQL/MongoDB/etc.) and deployable as-is.

Stay tuned for more soon.
